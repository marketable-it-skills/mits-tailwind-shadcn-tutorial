# Module 3: Typography & Text Styling

## Overview

In this module, you'll refine the typography and text hierarchy of your cards to create a more professional and readable design. You'll learn how to use Tailwind's typography utilities to control font sizes, weights, spacing, and text truncation.

## What You'll Learn

- **Tailwind typography utilities** - Font sizes, weights, line heights
- **Text hierarchy** - Creating visual hierarchy with typography
- **Spacing utilities** - Margin, padding, and gap for better layout
- **Text truncation** - Line clamping for long content
- **Text opacity** - Subtle color variations for secondary content

## Why This Matters

Good typography is fundamental to great UI design:

1. **Readability** - Proper font sizes and spacing make content easy to read
2. **Hierarchy** - Different text styles guide users through information
3. **Professionalism** - Well-crafted typography signals quality
4. **Accessibility** - Sufficient contrast and sizing help all users

Typography can make or break a design. Even with perfect colors and layout, poor typography will make your UI feel unprofessional.

## Starting Point

You should have completed **Module 2** and have:

- Three color-themed cards (light, dark, colored)
- Responsive layout
- Understanding of Tailwind's color system

## What We're Building

We'll enhance our cards with:

1. **Better text hierarchy**
   - Larger, bolder titles
   - Subtle subtitle between title and description
   - Clear visual separation

2. **Improved readability**
   - Proper font sizing
   - Optimal line heights
   - Better spacing between elements

3. **Professional details**
   - Text truncation for long content
   - Reduced opacity for secondary text
   - Consistent spacing patterns

## PRD Connection

This module implements typography specifications from the PRD:

> **Core Features → Project Cards → Visual Components**
>
> - Title: text-lg or text-xl, font-bold
> - Subtitle: text-base or text-md
> - Description: text-sm, reduced opacity
> - Behavior: Truncate if exceeds specified lines

Understanding typography now prepares you for building the complete card component in future modules!

## Time Estimate

**25-35 minutes**

## Module Structure

1. **Task 1**: Understand Tailwind's typography system
2. **Task 2**: Enhance title typography
3. **Task 3**: Add subtitle to card
4. **Task 4**: Improve description styling
5. **Task 5**: Add text truncation
6. **Task 6**: Fine-tune spacing

## Expected Result

By the end of this module, your cards will have:

- Clear visual hierarchy with different text sizes
- Professional-looking subtitles
- Truncated descriptions with ellipsis
- Perfect spacing between all elements
- Enhanced readability across all theme variations

## Learning Approach

This module focuses on **refinement and polish**. You'll learn:

- How small typography changes create big impacts
- Why spacing matters as much as font size
- How to create hierarchy without color
- The art of restraint (when to stop adding styles!)

Let's make our cards look professional!
