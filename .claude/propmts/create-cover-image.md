## Image Specifications

- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape, suitable for tutorial banners)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 pixels or higher
- **Style**: Modern, clean, professional, tech-focused

## Main Prompt

Create a modern, eye-catching cover image for a web development tutorial titled **"MITS Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI Tutorial"**. The image should convey learning, modern web development, and component-based UI design.

### Visual Elements to Include:

1. **Central Focus**:

   - A stylized laptop or browser window displaying a colorful, modern dashboard interface
   - The dashboard should show multiple card components in a grid layout (3 columns)
   - Cards should have vibrant gradient backgrounds (cyan, purple, rose, emerald tones)

2. **UI Components Floating Around**:
   - Subtle floating UI elements like:
     - Badges with different colors
     - Toggle switches for dark/light mode
     - Responsive design icons (mobile, tablet, desktop)
     - Code snippets with Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `className="p-6 bg-gradient-to-r"`)
     - Typography samples showing different font sizes
3. **Technology Stack Icons** (subtle, in corners or background):
   - React logo
   - Tailwind CSS logo (prominent, teal/cyan colored)
   - TypeScript logo
   - Vite logo (lightning bolt)
4. **Color Scheme**:

   - Primary: Tailwind's signature cyan/teal (#06B6D4)
   - Accents: Purple (#8B5CF6), Rose (#F43F5E), Emerald (#10B981)
   - Background: Dark gradient (navy to purple) OR light gradient (white to light blue)
   - Include both light and dark theme hints (split-screen or gradient transition)

5. **Typography**:

   - Bold, modern title: **"Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI"**
   - Subtitle: **"Build Modern Dashboards with React"**
   - Small badge/label: **"MITS Pilot Program"** or **"10-Module Tutorial"**
   - Use sans-serif, geometric fonts (like Inter, Poppins, or Space Grotesk)

6. **Visual Style**:

   - Glassmorphism effects on UI cards (semi-transparent with blur)
   - Subtle grid pattern or dot pattern in background
   - Soft shadows and depth (z-axis layering)
   - Smooth gradients and rounded corners
   - Modern, minimalist aesthetic
   - Slight 3D perspective on the main dashboard display

7. **Additional Details**:
   - Add a subtle glow/neon effect around key elements
   - Include visual indicators of responsiveness (mobile → tablet → desktop icons)
   - Show code editor window snippet in the background (very subtle, blurred)
   - Add small decorative elements: checkmarks, stars, or learning progression indicators

### Mood & Atmosphere:

- **Professional yet approachable**
- **Energetic and inspiring** (encourages learning)
- **Clean and uncluttered** (focus on key elements)
- **Modern tech aesthetic** (2024-2025 design trends)
- **Colorful but balanced** (not overwhelming)

### What to Avoid:

- Cluttered or busy compositions
- Stock photo people or generic office scenes
- Outdated web design aesthetics
- Too many text elements (keep it visual)
- Flat, boring layouts without depth

## Alternative Prompt (Minimalist Version)

Create a clean, minimalist cover image featuring:

- A large, centered browser window with a modern dashboard interface
- 3 prominent project cards with gradient backgrounds (cyan, purple, rose)
- Floating Tailwind utility class labels around the cards (e.g., "grid-cols-3", "rounded-lg", "shadow-lg")
- Tailwind CSS logo in the top corner
- Dark-to-light gradient background with subtle grid pattern
- Title text overlay: "Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI Tutorial"
- Accent colors: Tailwind cyan, purple, and rose

## Reference Style

Think of: **Apple product marketing + GitHub's design aesthetic + Modern SaaS landing pages**
