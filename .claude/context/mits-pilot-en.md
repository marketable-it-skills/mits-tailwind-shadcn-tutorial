# MITS (Marketable IT Skills) Pilot

## What Is MITS?

**MITS (Marketable IT Skills: Integrating Real-World Challenges into Vocational Education)** is a project supported by the European Union’s Erasmus+ program. Its goal is to provide realistic, workplace‑simulating project tasks for young people preparing for IT careers.  
In its current phase, the MITS task repository contains project tasks from the field of **web development**. Each task is an adapted version of a module task from previous skills competitions, following a unified structure.

The platform offers user‑friendly access to all tasks, allowing various search and filtering options, viewing detailed task descriptions, downloading supplementary materials, and evaluating completed work through the built‑in scoring module.

The MITS project is led by the **HTTP Foundation**, in cooperation with **Helsinki Business College**.

## What Should You Know About the MITS Pilot?

In this phase of the project, the **beta version** of the MITS web platform has been completed, and the task repository already includes **more than 25 adapted competition tasks**.  
These tasks originate from:

- WorldSkills and EuroSkills past competition modules  
- Preparation competitions  
- National selection events

The closed pilot aims to test the usability of both the platform and the tasks, assess student progress during the pilot period, and refine the system and task collection based on feedback.

## Pilot Duration

**November 2025 – January 2026**

---

## Who Can Participate in the Pilot?

The MITS pilot involves **10 Hungarian** and **10 Finnish** selected student groups.  
On the Hungarian side, participation is open to groups enrolled in the **Software Developer and Tester Technician** specialization (grades 11–13 of the five‑year vocational program).

---

## How Does the Pilot Work?

Each student group must complete **at least one project task**.  
While the original competition tasks were designed for **3–4 hours** of contest time, students in vocational education will require significantly more time.

Ideally, task completion is integrated into the teaching process, where the instructor—acting as a mentor—identifies knowledge gaps and helps students acquire the necessary skills.  
For example, if a design implementation task requires advanced CSS techniques that students have not yet learned, the instructor may:

- Demonstrate the concepts with additional examples  
- Provide smaller practice tasks  
- Offer guidance for independent learning  

Throughout the pilot, instructors receive continuous professional support from the **HTTP Foundation** and **Helsinki Business College**.

### Registration Requirements

Students and instructors must have a **GitHub account**.  
At the start of registration, the platform redirects users to the GitHub login page, after which a short form collects essential personal data.  
Administrator approval (1–2 days) is required to activate the account, and confirmation is sent via email.

## What Tasks Are Available in MITS?

The tasks focus on various areas of web development, typically (but not exclusively) including:

### 1. Design Implementation Tasks  
Creating a multi‑page website from a description or visual mockup using primarily **HTML and CSS**.  
JavaScript use is generally **not allowed**.

### 2. Interactive Web Application with Server‑Side Rendering  
Developing an admin interface using frameworks such as **Laravel**, **Next.js**, or similar.  
Tasks usually include **database management**, ideally implemented through an ORM.

### 3. REST API Backend Development  
Creating a REST API backend with **Laravel**, **Express.js**, or similar technologies, following detailed specifications or OpenAPI documentation.  
Database handling via ORM is typically required.

### 4. REST API Frontend Development  
Building the frontend component of the REST API task using **React**, **Vue**, **Angular**, or other JavaScript frameworks.  
A functioning backend and database are provided.

### 5. Other Web Development Tasks  
Additional tasks focus on specialized areas such as **progressive web applications** or **JavaScript testing**.

During the pilot, participants may choose **one or more** tasks from the first four categories.
