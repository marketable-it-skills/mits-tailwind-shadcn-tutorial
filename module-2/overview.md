# Module 2: Playing with Colors - Light & Dark Cards

## Overview

In this module, you'll explore Tailwind CSS's powerful color system by creating three different card variations: a light theme card, a dark theme card, and a colored accent card. This hands-on exploration will help you understand how colors, contrast, and design tokens work together to create beautiful interfaces.

## What You'll Learn

- **Tailwind's color system** - Understanding color scales (50, 100, 200...900, 950)
- **Color naming conventions** - How gray, slate, blue, and other colors are organized
- **Text contrast and readability** - Choosing the right text colors for backgrounds
- **Color relationships** - How background, text, and border colors work together
- **Responsive layout** - Displaying multiple cards side-by-side

## Why This Matters

Understanding color systems is crucial for:

1. **Creating consistent designs** - Using a predefined palette ensures harmony
2. **Building theme support** - Light/dark modes require understanding color contrast
3. **Accessibility** - Proper contrast ratios make your UI usable for everyone
4. **Design confidence** - No more guessing hex codes or RGB values

Before building complex theme systems (Module 10), you need to understand how Tailwind's colors work at a fundamental level.

## Starting Point

You should have completed **Module 1** and have a working project with:

- ✅ Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 configured
- ✅ A single centered card with title and description

## What We're Building

Three card variations displayed side-by-side (or stacked on mobile):

1. **Light Card** - White background, dark text, light borders
2. **Dark Card** - Dark slate background, light text, dark borders
3. **Colored Card** - Blue tinted background, blue text, blue borders

Each card will display the same content but with different color schemes, helping you visualize how color choices affect the overall design.

## PRD Connection

This module prepares you for implementing the theme system specified in the PRD:

> **Theme System → Color Palette**
>
> - Light Theme colors (white, gray tones)
> - Dark Theme colors (slate, dark backgrounds)

Understanding these color relationships now will make implementing the full theme toggle (Module 10) much easier!

## Time Estimate

⏱️ **30-40 minutes**

## Module Structure

1. **Task 1**: Understand Tailwind's color scales
2. **Task 2**: Create the multi-card layout
3. **Task 3**: Build the light theme card
4. **Task 4**: Build the dark theme card
5. **Task 5**: Build the colored accent card
6. **Task 6**: Experiment with different color combinations

## Expected Result

By the end of this module, you'll have:

Three beautiful cards displayed horizontally, each showing a different color theme. You'll understand:

- How to choose colors that work well together
- Why certain text colors work on certain backgrounds
- How Tailwind's color scales make design decisions easier
- The foundation for building theme-aware components

## Learning Approach

This module is **experimental and playful**! You'll:

- Try different color combinations
- See what works and what doesn't
- Understand contrast ratios through practice
- Build intuition for color selection

Don't worry about getting it "perfect" - the goal is to explore and understand!
